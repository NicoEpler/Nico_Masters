\chapter{Interesting Additional Components to Investigate}

A place where I add random ideas or notes that we should consider. Please remove once they have been dealt with:


\section{Nico}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Full frame not needed, do not want to block the camera/lidar view \cite{RMFOwl}
		\item Aiming to support the goal of autonomous exploration in diverse subterranean settings \cite{RMFOwl}
		\item Make a resilient micro flyer
		\item Use mini drones for full local map completion \cite{GraphBased}
		\item ``mother'' and ``baby'' robot, which is released to map hard to acess areas \cite{DarpaMultiRobot}
		\item valid option to provide rapid situational awareness to a small team of operators prior to possible entry in such unknown and dynamic areas \cite{Cerberus}
		\item aerial scouts \cite{Cerberus}
		\item Flying robots were the complimentary system to fill the gap and explore highly vertical environments and impassable terrain. \cite{Cerberus}
	\end{itemize}

\section{Hansie}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Provide rapid situational awareness to a team of operators \cite{DarpaSynopsis}
		\item Tethered robot and deployable nodes \cite{Cerberus}
	\end{itemize}
