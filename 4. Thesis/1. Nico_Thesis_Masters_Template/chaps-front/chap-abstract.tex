Vibrating a tillage tool is an effective way of reducing the draft force
required to pull it through the soil. The degree of draft force reduction is
dependent on the combination of operating parameters and soil conditions. It
is thus necessary to optimize the vibratory implement for different
conditions.

Numerical modelling is more flexible than experimental testing and analytical
models, and less costly than experimental testing. The Discrete Element
Method (DEM) was specifically developed for granular materials such as soils
and can be used to model a vibrating tillage tool for its design and
optimization. The goal was thus to evaluate the ability of DEM to model a
vibratory subsoiler and to investigate the cause of the draft force
reduction.

The DEM model was evaluated against data ...
