# Construction guides and tips

- buzzed/light with built in battery, to retrieve drone, when lost underground
- LiPo vs. Li-ion (Use LiPo):

- Drone Basics (https://oscarliang.com/fpv-drone-guide/#Basic-Drone-Control)
	- Motors:
		- Lower KV ratings for better efficiency
		- Larger LiPo or Li-ion Batteries
		- 
	- Propellers:
		- Lower pitch propeller for better efficiency
		- 5" = smaller, 7" more payload and better efficiency
		- Therefore 6" might be optimal? but check availability?
	-  Flight Controller
		- Popular firmware = Betaflight 
			- open-source
			- performs well
			- updated frequently
			- huge selection of flight controllers available
			- added features for long-range flights
		- 
	- ESC 
		- Popular firmware = BLHeli_S or BLHeli_32 (99% of FPV's)
		- Firmware: BLHeli_32 Is faster and more future proof
		- Protocol: DShot300 and DShot600 (number is speed of controller)
	- Blackbox: for tuning drone. 
		- records flight data which can be used for tuning PID settings

- Extend drone Time of flight (https://oscarliang.com/improve-fpv-drone-flight-time-efficiency/)
	- Higher C-rating = less voltage sag but more inefficient
	- Li-ion = ~double capacity for same weight, but lower discharge rate
	- Lower pitch propeller for better efficiency
	- 5" = smaller, 7" more payload and better efficiency
	- Properly balance Center of gravity (COG). 4 motors working at same level = higher efficiency

	- Build tutorial: (https://oscarliang.com/how-to-build-fpv-drone/)
- Propellers(https://oscarliang.com/propellers/#Propeller-Size)
	- Suggestion: HQ props, triblades = more smoothness
		- For 6":
			- long range and flight time: Gemfan Hurricane 6038-4
			- Speed and racing: HQ DP 6×4.5×3
		- For 5":
			- All rounder:  HQ 5×4.3×3 V2S
			- Durable and cheap: DAL Cyclone 5045C
		- For 7":
			- All rounder: HQ DP 7×3.5×3-v1s
	- Mounting Propellers:
		- 2 CW and 2 CCW
		- CW (R)= left top + right bottom (Betaflight default)
		- CCW (C)= left bottom + right top (Betaflight default)
	- Components compatibility table (https://oscarliang.com/table-prop-motor-lipo-weight/)
	- Props can produce 20-30% less thrust in air compared to static thrust test
